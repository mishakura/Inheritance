Upon running ./inheritance, your program should adhere to the rules described in the background. The child should have two alleles, one from each parent. The parents should each have two alleles, one from each of their parents.

For example, in the example below, the child in Generation 0 received an O allele from both Generation 1 parents. The first parent received an A from the first grandparent and a O from the second grandparent. Similarly, the second parent received an O and a B from their grandparents.

$ ./inheritance
Generation 0, blood type OO
    Generation 1, blood type AO
        Generation 2, blood type OA
        Generation 2, blood type BO
    Generation 1, blood type OB
        Generation 2, blood type AO
        Generation 2, blood type BO
